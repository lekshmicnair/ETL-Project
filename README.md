# ETL-Project

Many theaters worldwide have closed indefinitely due to the pandemic leaving the movie lovers missing the theater experience. Most see this as an opening for streaming services. But it has also brought an appreciation for the pleasures of going to the movies and their role in social life.

For our love of movies, we have compiled a list of Movie datasets based on ranking, movie name, budget, cost, revenue and rating by drawing on information from different sources. We have performed an ETL on Movie data to narrate the history and specifics of the world movie, list of movies on Netflix and the plot of the Cinema from Wikipedia.
